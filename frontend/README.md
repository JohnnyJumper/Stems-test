## Overview:

This frontend page is a single-page application built using React and TypeScript. The main functionality of this page is to allow users to search for a book title from a database. As the user types the title, suggestions will appear in a pop-up window.

## Functionality:

As the user types in the search input field, the InputWithSuggestions component will update the input state.
The App component will then make a request to the database using the input as a parameter.
The database will return an array of suggested book titles based on the searchTerm.
The App component will update the suggestions state with the array of suggested book titles.
The Suggestions component will receive the updated suggestions state as a prop and render the list of suggested book titles in a pop-up window.
Usage:

To use this page, simply type a book title in the search input field.
Suggestions will appear in a pop-up window as you type.
Click on one of the suggested book titles to select it.

## Note:

This page assumes that there is a backend API that can handle requests for book title suggestions based on user input. Additionally, this page does not include any functionality for actually selecting a book or displaying book details.
